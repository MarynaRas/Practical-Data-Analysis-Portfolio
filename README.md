# Practical-Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Welcome to my Practical Data Analysis Portfolio! 
This repository showcases three data analysis projects I have worked on. Each project is described below:

## Project 1: Prenatal Tobacco Exposure & Child Outcomes - Exploratory Data Analysis

### Overview
This project is dedicated to the exploratory data analysis of a comprehensive dataset examining the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on various child outcomes. We aim to gain insights into how prenatal tobacco exposure influences child self-regulation, externalizing behaviors, and substance use.

### Data Source
We analyzed a dataset comprising information from approximately 800 pregnant individuals exposed to prenatal tobacco smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and their children aged 12-16 years. The dataset contains a wide array of demographic, diagnostic, and behavioral parameters.

### Repository Structure

- `Project1_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.Rmd`: R Markdown file with detailed code and explanations of the exploratory data analysis.
- `Project1_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.pdf`: PDF document summarizing the analysis, findings, and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing a summary of the project, data sources, methods, and repository structure.

## Project 2: Predictive Modeling for Tracheostomy in Severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (sBPD)

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting the need for tracheostomy in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). We develop regression models using NICU data to predict tracheostomy or death in infants with sBPD.

### Data Source
Our analysis is based on a national dataset encompassing demographic, diagnostic, and respiratory parameters of infants diagnosed with sBPD. Parameters measured at 36 and 44 weeks Post-Menstrual Age (PMA) were crucial in the analysis.

## Project 3: Assessing Predictive Model Transferability

### Overview
This project assesses the transferability of a predictive model from the Framingham Heart Study to the NHANES population. It includes simulation studies to address challenges in model transportability due to demographic differences between source and target datasets.

### Data Source
We combine data from the Framingham Heart Study and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

### Repository Structure
