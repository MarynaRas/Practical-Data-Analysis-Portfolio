# Assessing Predictive Model Transporability

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the work for "Assessing Predictive Model Transferability from Framingham to NHANES: A Biostatistical Simulation Approach." It focuses on evaluating the performance of the Framingham Heart Study's cardiovascular disease risk model when applied to the NHANES population. The project includes simulation studies to address challenges in model transportability due to demographic differences between source and target datasets.

## Data Source
The analysis combines data from the Framingham Heart Study and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

## Methods
- `Data Preprocessing`: Integration and cleaning of Framingham and NHANES datasets.
- `Simulation Design`: Implementing various correlation scenarios to test model performance.
- `Statistical Analysis': Using logistic regression and Inverse Probability of Selection Weights (IPSW) for transportability assessment.
- `Performance Evaluation`: Brier scores are used to evaluate predictive accuracy.

## Repository Structure
-  `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `Project 3.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the detailed code.
- `Project 3.pdf`: PDF document of the compiled analysis and findings.
- `README.md`: Describes the project, methodology, and repository contents.
