# Prenatal Tobacco Exposure & Child Outcomes: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository is dedicated to the exploratory data analysis of a comprehensive dataset examining the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on various child outcomes. Our goal is to gain insights into how prenatal tobacco exposure influences child self-regulation, externalizing behaviors, and substance use.

## Data Source
We base our analysis on a dataset comprising information from approximately 800 pregnant individuals exposed to prenatal tobacco smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and their children aged 12-16 years. The dataset contains a wide array of demographic, diagnostic, and behavioral parameters, allowing us to investigate tobacco exposure's effects on child development comprehensively.

## Analysis Methods
Our analytical process follows these steps:

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: We removed duplicate entries, addressed discrepancies, and managed missing data.
- **Standardization**: Variable names and formats were standardized for consistency.
- **Categorization**: Categorical variables were converted into numerical format when necessary.
- **Imputation**: Missing values were imputed using appropriate methods to ensure data completeness.

### Composite Variables
To aid our analysis, we created several composite variables:
- **Prenatal Exposure Severity Variable (SDP)**: Quantifies the severity of maternal smoking during pregnancy.
- **Postnatal Exposure Severity Variable (ETS)**: Evaluates the severity of environmental tobacco smoke exposure postnatally.
- **Dependent Variables**: Variables for child self-regulation (SR), externalizing behaviors (EXT), and substance use (SU) were derived from relevant questionnaire responses.

## Discussion
Our exploratory data analysis serves as a foundation for understanding the complex connections between maternal tobacco exposure and various child outcomes. While preliminary findings suggest potential associations, further investigations and analyses are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms comprehensively. Future research directions may include longitudinal studies, consideration of genetic factors, and qualitative research, ultimately leading to evidence-based interventions to improve child and adolescent health.
